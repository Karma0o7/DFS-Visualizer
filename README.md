# DFS-Visualizer
This is Visualizer implemented using Python to Visualize Depth First Search Algorithm to find its way around a maze.

# Steps to run:
1. git clone https://github.com/Karma0o7/DFS-Visualizer.git
2. python main.py {maze_text_file name}  (eg. python main.py maze1.txt)
3. Output is printed in the console.
4. a png image is created to look at all the paths alogithm took

# Create custom maze
1. A :- Denotes the start point.
2. B :- Denotes the goal/end point.
3. "#" :- denotes the path.
4. " " :- Space denotes the way that algorithm can take
5. for example look at text1.txt
